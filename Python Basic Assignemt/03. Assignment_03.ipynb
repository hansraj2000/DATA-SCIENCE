    "\n",
    "**Answer :-** The main advantage of functions is code reusablility. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.By including functions, we can prevent repeating the same code block repeatedly in a program. Functions, once defined, can be called many times and from anywhere in a program."
