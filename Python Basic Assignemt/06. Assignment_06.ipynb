    "Mutable data types, on the other hand, are those whose values can be modified after they are created. Operations performed on a mutable object can directly modify its value without creating a new object. This means that the identity of a mutable object remains the same, but its value can change. Examples of mutable data types in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n",

    "Immutable data types are those whose values cannot be modified after they are created. Whenever an operation is performed on an immutable object, a new object is created with the modified value, while the original object remains unchanged. This means that the identity and value of an immutable object are fixed. Examples of immutable data types include numbers (integers, floats), strings, and tuples.\n",
