    "`'/'`: This is the regular division operator in most programming languages. It performs floating-point division, which means it returns a floating-point result (decimal number) even if the operands are integers. For example, 7 / 2 will give the result 3.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "`'//'`: This is known as the floor division or integer division operator. It performs division and rounds the result down to the nearest whole number, discarding any fractional part. For example, 7 // 2 will give the result 3, as it rounds down the result of the division 3.5 to 3.\n",
